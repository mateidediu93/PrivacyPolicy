# Privacy Policy for HomePlay

**Last Updated:** December 12, 2025

## Introduction

HomePlay (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting the privacy of children and families. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application (“App”).

HomePlay is designed with privacy as a core principle — **all activity content and usage remains on your device**, and we do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.

You remain in full control of your device data.
